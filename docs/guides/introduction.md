# Introduction

[StreetMesh](https://github.com/StreetMesh) is an open source framework for spatially organizing the web, building upon open standards and existing protocols.

Now, you may be reading that sentence and wondering to yourself, "How did I get here? What are these people talking about? What do they mean, 'spatially'? Why do I care?" These are all wonderful questions. 

So let's start there.

## The First Web: Information

The [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) was born in 1989, and went public in 1993. A really smart British guy named [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) invented a bunch of technologies—including HTML, URLs, and HTTP—and gave birth to [web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page): a simple, robust, visual communication toolset that unlocked an unprecedented era of hyper-connection and rapid communication.

While Tim Berners-Lee created the first Web browser, it was a company called [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) that moved the Web out of the academic space and into so-called "personal computing." 

In 1995, in a bid to make the Web and webpages more interactive, Netscape created the scripting language [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Less than one year later, another new technology called [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) would create separation between *content* and *layout*, allowing the web to become [beautiful](https://csszengarden.com/) while still being [accessible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility).

Every webpage on every website that you've ever interacted with, from Amazon.com to Wikipedia, was built upon these base technologies. If you're a web developer, every framework you've ever used was built upon this platform: [jQuery](https://jquery.com), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and so many others.

This was Web 1.0. The browser-makers fought [wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars) over standardization and market dominance, but still, it was a simpler time.

## The Second Web: Participation

In 1999, [Darcy DiNucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_DiNucci) coined the term "Web 2.0":

> "The Web we know now, which loads into a browser window in essentially static screenfuls, is only an embryo of the Web to come. The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are just starting to see how that embryo might develop. The Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven."

Web 2.0 gave birth to the *dot-com startup*, which [bubbled and then burst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) and unleashed household names we still have today, like Amazon and eBay. That early volatility created a new economic space that today contains enormously valuable companies that serve their customers exclusively through the Web—not only by ecommerce, but also through entire software tools, like Slack, Google Workspace, and Zoom.

This era of the Web is marked by the rise of participation and collaboration, much of which happens in the *social web*, with much of that activity occuring on specially made software called "apps" that run on pocket-sized computers that for some (reasonable) reason we still call "phones." While not like browsers, apps still rely heavily on the same base technologies that powered the first Web. 

Some apps are even made using core web technologies—HTML, CSS and JavaScript—and are [wrapped](https://cordova.apache.org/) to run on our mobile devices.

The social web a [grand experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fZwusCcT9I) we are running on humanity. Much of the social web is funded by [targeted advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising): a new form of marketing made possible by the data we all feed into the Web simply by using the tools and services that live there. Our attention has a cash value, and so the social web has been designed to extract as much of our attention as possible. 

[This is a big problem](https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_a_handful_of_tech_companies_control_billions_of_minds_every_day), and we still haven't figured out how to fix it.

And so this is Web 2.0, still alive today. The world went online, created new ways of exchanging goods and services, subjected our minds and our societies to systemic forces we are still working to understand, and gave rise to a new class: the tech-billionare-enterpreneur.

## The Third Web: Decentralization

Web3 might be a fairy tale. It is an idea about the way the Web *can be* if we all agree to work to reorganize it. 

Web 1.0 was a vision for a world of information that was interlinked and could be explored by both humans and machines. Web 2.0 is a platform for business and communication that can only exist because the vision for Web 1.0 was executed so successfully.
