What are these people talking about? What do they mean, &#39;spatially&#39;? Why do I care?&quot; These are all wonderful questions.</p><p>So let&#39;s start there.</p><h2 id="the-first-web-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-first-web-information"><span>The First Web: Information</span></a></h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Wide Web</a> was born in 1989, and went public in 1993. A really smart British guy named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Berners-Lee</a> invented a bunch of technologies—including HTML, URLs, and HTTP—and gave birth to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web pages</a>: a simple, robust, visual communication toolset that unlocked an unprecedented era of hyper-connection and rapid communication.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web"></p><p>While Tim Berners-Lee created the first Web browser, it was a company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netscape</a> that moved the Web out of the academic space and into so-called &quot;personal computing.&quot;</p><p>In 1995, in a bid to make the Web and webpages more interactive, Netscape created the scripting language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript</a>. Less than one year later, another new technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cascading Style Sheets</a> would create separation between <em>content</em> and <em>layout</em>, allowing the web to become <a href="https://csszengarden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful</a> while still being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessible</a>.</p><p>Every webpage on every website that you&#39;ve ever interacted with, from Amazon.com to Wikipedia, was built upon these base technologies. If you&#39;re a web developer, every framework you&#39;ve ever used—jQuery, Vue, React, Angular, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and so many other tools—was built upon this platform.</p><p>This was Web 1.0. The browser-makers fought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wars</a> over standardization and market dominance, but still, it was a simpler time.</p><h2 id="the-second-web-participation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-second-web-participation"><span>The Second Web: Participation</span></a></h2><p>In 1999, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_DiNucci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darcy DiNucci</a> coined the term &quot;Web 2.0&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The Web we know now, which loads into a browser window in essentially static screenfuls, is only an embryo of the Web to come. The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are just starting to see how that embryo might develop. The Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Web 2.0 gave birth to the <em>dot-com startup</em>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bubbled and then burst</a> and unleashed household names we still have today, like Amazon and eBay. That early volatility created a new economic space that today contains enormously valuable companies that serve their customers exclusively through the Web—not only by ecommerce, but also through entire software tools, like Slack, Google Workspace, and Zoom.</p><p>This era of the Web is marked by the rise of participation and collaboration, much of which happens in the <em>social web</em>, with much of that activity occuring on specially made software called &quot;apps&quot; that run on pocket-sized computers that for some reason we still call &quot;phones.&quot; While not like browsers, these &quot;apps&quot; still rely on the same base technologies that powered the first Web.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="People using their cell phones on the train"></p><h2 id="the-third-web-decentralization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-third-web-decentralization"><span>The Third Web: Decentralization</span></a></h2><h2 id="the-next-web-posthumanization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-next-web-posthumanization"><span>The Next Web: Posthumanization</span></a></h2><h2 id="the-spatial-web" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-spatial-web"><span>The Spatial Web</span></a></h2>',20)]))}const p=t(s,[["render",l]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/guides/introduction.html","title":"Introduction","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"The First Web: Information","slug":"the-first-web-information","link":"#the-first-web-information","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"The Second Web: Participation","slug":"the-second-web-participation","link":"#the-second-web-participation","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"The Third Web: Decentralization","slug":"the-third-web-decentralization","link":"#the-third-web-decentralization","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"The Next Web: Posthumanization","slug":"the-next-web-posthumanization","link":"#the-next-web-posthumanization","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"The Spatial Web","slug":"the-spatial-web","link":"#the-spatial-web","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1744290112000,"contributors":[{"name":"Aaron Collegeman","username":"","email":"aaron@c21redwood.com","commits":1},{"name":"collegeman","username":"collegeman","email":"aaron@collegeman.net","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/collegeman"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"b845cb820c256945257bf9eacd11a35cdbc018ef","time":1744290112000,"email":"aaron@collegeman.net","author":"collegeman","message":"Update"},{"hash":"078e0bdafb446a81f349ae8a158a04f536f579db","time":1744215917000,"email":"aaron@collegeman.net","author":"collegeman","message":"Setting up navigation"},{"hash":"cd0c80e6629a591426604e9904d4773e09635bb0","time":1744213280000,"email":"aaron@c21redwood.com","author":"Aaron Collegeman","message":"Project content initialization"}]},"filePathRelative":"guides/introduction.md"}');export{p as comp,d as data};
